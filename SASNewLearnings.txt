
for labe encoding
1)either label encoding by giving discrete values to all the categories
2) looking at the % of that category and then clubbing the same percentages tofether to form one label. % here means % of records of that category in total table. But this can be sometimes misleading so we go one step further
y it can be misleading?? lets say 
Cat  %
A    

we check for respoder %=(total of that category/total records)
the category % where target for that category is 1 i.e  category(where target==1)/category(total target is 0 or 1)  
we usually check tis resp_% for small %values
